# Bootiful Spring Boot: the tutorial (new in 2025!)


Hi, Spring fans! Spring is more amazing than ever, with so many possibilities at your finger tips! 

In this video, we're going to pull together some of those amazing possibilities in this roughly two hour long tutorial on Spring Boot, with discussions of:

- dependency injection 
- auto-configuration
- Spring Framework 
- Spring Data (JDBC)
- Spring MVC
- Spring Batch
- Spring Integration
- Spring AMQP
- Spring Modulith 
- Testing
- Virtual Threads
- GraalVM
- Docker Compose
- Observability
- Spring AI 
- Spring GraphQL 
- Spring gRPC 
- Spring Security
- Spring Cloud Config Server
- OAuth Resource Servers 
- Spring Authorization Server 
- OAuth Clients 
- Spring Cloud Config Client 
- Spring Cloud Gateway 
- Spring Boot 

Actually, it's sort of easier to take from the list of projects over at https://spring.io/projects and discuss what we did *NOT* have enough time to get to:

- Spring Web Services
- Spring Cloud Data Flow 
- Spring Statemachine 
- Spring Shell
- Spring Session 
- Spring for Apache Kafka
- Spring for Apache Pulsar
- Spring Webflow 
- Spring LDAP
- Spring CLI

You're invited to follow along at home (after you've watched the whole thing once - breadth, _then_ depth!)! The code for this demo can be found here: https://github.com/joshlong-attic/2025-a-walking-tour-of-spring-boot
